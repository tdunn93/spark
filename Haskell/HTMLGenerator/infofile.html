Around since the early 1990's, 4hero have influenced many styles under many monikers; from jungle to drum'n'bass, from hip-hop to techno. The genre "broken beat", it could be argued, was virtually created off the back of their album "Two Pages" (1998). They have also produced for many artists large and small, including the likes of Jill Scott, and Ultra Nat√©, et al. Over the years, they have set-up many labels, each one often reflecting the various music scenes they were in at the time: Reinforced Records, 2000 Black, Twisted Funk, Omniverse, and Raw Canvas Records. <br><br> Notable releases: <ol> <p><li><i>Mr.Kirk's Nightmare</i><p>Mr.Kirk... your son is dead.....</li><p><li><i>Universal Love</i><p>All about the Nookie mix on this one, tuff!</li><p><li><i>Two Pages Reinterpretations</i><p>Great collection of future jazz/deep house and drum n bass remixes from the OG UK underground dons!</li> </ol> <hr><p> <center> <table width=100% cellpadding=0> <tr> <td align=left> </td> </tr> </table> </center> </body>
